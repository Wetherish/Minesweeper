# Minesweeper-2022

Minesweeper was my first project at University. Everyone in our course group got guidelines on how our program should work. We had to prepare the code at home. During the course, we had the opportunity to consult our issues with the professor. Here I was learning Object-oriented programming. For the first time, I was using SFML.  

# Issues

I have some issues with the font in several places on the board. Unfortunately couldn't find time to fix it.
